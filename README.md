E-Mobility Market Dynamics: DRIVERS, REGULATIONS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS FOR INFORMED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

Data-Driven Market Analysis: Developed a regression model using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to quantitatively analyze factors influencing the European e-mobility market, such as tax incentives and subsidies.

Challenges in Modeling Real-World Complexity: The model faced limitations in predictive success due to the complexity of real-world factors, including limited data availability, the difficulty of quantifying key variables, and the presence of region-specific subjective influences.

Mixed-Methods Approach: Addressed the gaps by incorporating qualitative analysis of subjective key factors, enabling a holistic assessment of regulatory and market dynamics in the European e-mobility sector.

Insights for Stakeholders: Delivered actionable recommendations by analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data, offering a nuanced understanding of the e-mobility market to support policymakers and industry leaders in fostering sustainable EV infrastructure.
